    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>Sometimes I end up mentoring developers who kind of stumbled their way into programming, got enough knowledge to be
dangerous, which got them some gigs, and they’ve been busy ever since.</p>

<p>They usually come to me when they’re buried, or come up against some requirements they don’t know how to satisfy.</p>

<p>This is almost never for green-field development.  There’s already some existing code base, usually a bunch of files
floating around in the webroot that end with a .php extension.</p>

<p>Inside those files, I uncover atrocities.  Or, at least, areas where things can be improved with a some knowledge and
a little practice.</p>

<p>These developers aren’t dumb, or lazy. They’re ambitious, hard-working, and mostly self-taught/self-made.  They’ve 
typically been running a web development business, with real businesses for clients.  And their clients love them!<br />
Typically, this success has been their proverbial downfall.</p>

<p>These people <em>know</em> they should be improving their skills, but years of tight deadlines, demanding clients, and flavor-
of-the-week technology trends have made it so that, from the outside 2005-2015 seem like a lost decade.</p>

<p>As I work with these people, I try to facilitate incremental improvements in their understanding a practices.  Throwing
a framework at them is ineffective - they never have time or mental bandwidth to climb the learning curve. They do like 
tools and workflows that make them more efficient.  And such tools and workflows exist!</p>

<p>Each of the pages in this site are written to help such a developer take a small positive step forward as a developer.
Each page will dissect one bad practice, anti-pattern, or operational failing that I’ve encountered working with real
developers.  The page will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe what the developer was doing wrong.</li>
  <li>Explain why it was the wrong thing to do.</li>
  <li>Present and explore a better way.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate how adopting the better practice will improve their lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve started with the grand-daddy of PHP atrocities: <a href="/therapy/2015/02/17/stop-using-mysql-or-the-dog-gets-it.html">continued usage of the <code>mysql</code></a> library (exposed in PHP as the 
<code>mysql_*</code> family of functions).</p>
